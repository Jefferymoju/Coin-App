# Coin-App
Coin App with coinpaprika api using mvvm clean architecture and dependency injection
This app has only two screens. one to diplay the list of coins gotten from the coin paprika api
in a lazy column since the project is coded using jetpack compose, clean architecture and dagger hilt
The second screen is one that fetches the details of each coin and displays it and as thus this app has two use cases
One to get the list of coins and the other to get the details of each coin by the id.
